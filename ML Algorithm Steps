1. Data set path: https://www.isic-archive.com/#!/topWithHeader/wideContentTop/main

2. Type of classification
   > Multi class
     > Lables are shown below
       0: Melanoma
       1: Melanocytic Nevus
       2: Basal Cell Carcinoma
       3: Actinic Keratosis
       4: Benign Keratosis
       5: Dermatoﬁbroma
       6: Vascular Lesion
          
3. How to train the model ?
   > Ensemble of image processing and questionarie would be used to determine the possibility of skin cancer
   > Image processing would be done as described in section 3.1
   > Usage of questionarie would be analytical
   3.1 Inception resnet V2 
       > 164 layers deep
       > Requires 299 x 299 as image size
       > Basic inception resnet V2 architecture link: https://medium.com/the-owl/building-inception-resnet-v2-in-keras-from-scratch-a3546c4d93f0
       > Tensor Flow API Link: https://keras.io/api/applications/inceptionresnetv2/

4. Share the output to BFF - // To check with team how to achieve this 
   > Below are the details to be shared with BFF
     > Possibility of skin cancer categorize as High/Medium/Low
     > In either case, share the class and % of skin cancer which has highest probability
