     first step in the proposed framework is a preprocessing step, where the image is corrected for illumination variation (i.e. the presence of shadows and brightly illuminated areas). Our approach to the problem of correcting is a multi-stage illumination modeling algorithm. We assume an illumination-reflectance multiplicative model where each pixel from the Value colour channel (in the HSV colour space) can be decomposed into an illumination component and a reflectance component. The goal of the algorithm is to first estimate the illumination component and calculate the reflectance component using that illumination estimate.
In the VIP lab, the proposed multi-stage illumination modeling algorithm uses the following stages to estimate and correct for illumination variation (shown in Fig. 1):
